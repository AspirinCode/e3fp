Introduction
------------

The Extended 3-Dimensional FingerPrint (E3FP) [1]_ is a 3D molecular
fingerprinting method inspired by Extended Connectivity FingerPrints (ECFP)
[2]_, integrating tightly with the `RDKit <https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit>`_. 
It is developed by the `Keiser Lab <http://www.keiserlab.org>`_ at
`UCSF <https://www.ucsf.edu>`_ and maintained primarily by
`Seth Axen <http://sethaxen.com>`_.

For a thorough description of E3FP, please consult the original paper [1]_ and
its corresponding repository [3]_ or :ref:`usage`.

Documentation is hosted by `ReadTheDocs <http://e3fp.readthedocs.io>`_.

Contributing
------------

Development occurs on `GitHub <https://github.com/keiserlab/e3fp>`_.
Contributions, feature requests, and bug reports are greatly appreciated.
Please consult the `issue tracker <https://github.com/keiserlab/e3fp/issues>`_.
